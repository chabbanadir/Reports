## Summary of Commit `c1b91b3716ef8d33a31b4b640ff130b9d037da10`

This commit, authored by chabbanadir, focuses on significant dashboard development.  Key changes include the addition of a loading spinner and several new Vue components (`LoadingSpinner.vue`, `LanguageOverviewBlock.vue`, `RepositoryList.vue`, `RepositoryMetricsBlock.vue`, `UserProfileBlock.vue`) for enhanced user experience.  Existing components (`App.vue`, `AuthCallback.vue`, `Login.vue`, `Dashboard.vue`, `router/index.ts`) were also modified, primarily to integrate the new components and improve functionality. Notably, `vuetify` (v3.7.0-beta.1) was added as a dependency, suggesting a UI framework upgrade.  The changes to `App.vue` indicate styling adjustments to the dashboard's appearance.  `AuthCallback.vue` received substantial updates, likely improving authentication handling and user data management.


## Detailed Changes

The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files reflect the addition of `vuetify`.  Significant modifications were made to `AuthCallback.vue` (89 changes), `Dashboard.vue` (94 changes), and `Login.vue` (55 changes), indicating substantial UI and functionality improvements.  The addition of several new Vue components further supports this conclusion.


## Conclusion

This commit represents a major step forward in the development of CommitWiz's user interface and authentication flow. The integration of `vuetify` and the creation of new components suggest a more robust and user-friendly dashboard is emerging.  Further investigation into the specific changes within each file is recommended for a complete understanding.
