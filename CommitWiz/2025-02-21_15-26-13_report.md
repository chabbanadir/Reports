- **Author:** chabbanadir <moh.chabba@gmail.com>
- **Message:** Setting added, dashboard finished, wiz to be applied on the middleware.  This commit represents significant UI development and integration of a "wiz" feature (likely related to automation).

## Key Changes

This commit introduces substantial changes, primarily focused on UI enhancements and the addition of Axios for API interaction:

- **New Feature:** User settings modal (`Uiwiz/src/components/User/UserSettingsModal.vue`) added.
- **New Dependency:** Axios added for API calls (`Uiwiz/package.json`, `Uiwiz/package-lock.json`).
- **UI Updates:**  Extensive modifications to various UI components (`Uiwiz/src/components/Login/AuthCallback.vue`, `Uiwiz/src/components/TopBar.vue`, `Uiwiz/src/components/User/Dashboard.vue`, `Uiwiz/src/components/User/RepositoryList.vue`, `Uiwiz/src/components/User/UserProfileBlock.vue`).  The `TopBar` component was significantly refactored.  The `Dashboard` component now incorporates user profile, language overview, and repository metrics blocks. The `RepositoryList` component now uses a more responsive grid layout. The `UserProfileBlock` component now includes a settings modal.
- **"Wiz" Integration:**  The `AuthCallback` component now includes a `wiz` property, suggesting integration of the automation feature.


##  Impact

The changes suggest a major step towards completing the user interface and integrating core functionality. The addition of Axios indicates the application is now interacting with a backend service. The introduction of a "wiz" feature points to the implementation of automated report generation or code review capabilities.  Further investigation into the "wiz" functionality is recommended.
